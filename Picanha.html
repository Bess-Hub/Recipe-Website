<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>1 piece of picanha</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step</h3></center>
    <p>1. When picking a picanha choose one with not more than 1.6kg. A typical picanha is not much heavier than that, its cut it just after the third vein, you should be able to identify the veins. Everything after the thirs veis is gets tougher and it is not the picanha cut, but no issue in eating it.
        <br>
   <p>2. Picanha is best made in the barbecue, you can put the entire piece without seasoning, with the grease down for about 10 to 15 min. Carefull with the fire, since the grease will melt and lift more fire.</p><br>
   <p>3. Turn and leave it for 10 min as well.</p><br>
   <p>4. Take it out and let it rest for 20 min, so it stays juicy.</p><br>
   <p>5. Slice the picanha and finish in the grill again. If you are adding seasalt this is the moment. If you are adding refined salt add it after taking it from the barbecue like salt bae - I dont like him but you get the reference.</p><br>
        <p>
    Enjoy!
