    <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("lb-temp").innerHTML = "120F"'>Show me in Farenheit</button><br>
    <p>3. Once the milk is at the right temperature add the 2 table spoons of kefir and stir for 30 seconds.<br>
    4. Close the pot with a lid, put a blanket on top of it and let it rest for 8 hours.<br>
    5. After 8 hours, uncover the pot, remove the lid, the content should look like a regular yogurt with a bit of water on top.<br>
    6. Place the content in a coffee filter or a cloth and let it drain the excess of liquid. I usually leave it for 10 hours.<br>
    7. Place the content in a glass container, add salt and mix.<br>
    8. To serve you can put olive oil, and season it. Serve with bread.<br>
    Enjoy this great entrance!
